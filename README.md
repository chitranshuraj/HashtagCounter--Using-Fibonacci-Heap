# HashtagCounter--Using-Fibonacci-Heap
# Advanced Data Structure Project

The project titled Hashtag Counter has been developed in java
programming environment using JDK for compilation and
implementation. The objective of the project is to determine the most
frequent hashtags that are present in a given input file. The objective
specifies that the project has to be implemented using the data
structures Max Fibonacci Heap and Hash Table.

The following project can be run/implemented on a UNIX/LINUX
platform which supports JDK.The project has to be compiled in a
procedural manner; following the steps as mentioned below:
1. Compile the program by running the 'make' command in the
terminal. This compiles the .java files present in the project directory.
2. After the program has been compiled the user can run the hashtag
counter as following:

      -> java hashtagcounter [input_file_name]: 
      
          This returns the output in the terminal window.

      -> java hashtagcounter [input_file_name] [output_file_name]: 
      
          This returns the output as the output_file_name; created as a new file in the given directory.
